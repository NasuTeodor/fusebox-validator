# Fusebox Assembly Validator â€“ IIOT Integration
This project is designed to validate a variety of fusebox configurations and signal any errors made during their assembly.

## IIOT Environment
The system works in conjunction with a robotic arm that assembles fuseboxes.
Once assembled, the arm sends the data further down the assembly line to this validator module, which ensures everything is correctly put together before continuing the process.
